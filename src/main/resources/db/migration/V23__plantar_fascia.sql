        'Compression', 'Intermediate', 'None', 'Using a lacrosse ball to perform smr on your plantar fascia is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout, especially if you plan to perform lower body exercises that require the feet to be more mobile.
When you perform smr on the plantar fascia, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.', 'In a standing position, place the lacrosse ball directly underneath the bottom of your foot and apply pressure via your bodyweight.
Slowly roll the plantar region for 20-30 seconds.
Repeat on the other side.', 'The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.
Use your free hand to stabilize yourself while holding onto something.
Do not allow yourself to fall into overextension, keep tension through the abs.
If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.
Do not roll the front of the shoulder directly as this can cause irritation to the biceps tendon and anterior capsule.
Performing SMR may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.
If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.
If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.',
