For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core.
The squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree.
Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely.
Some of the squat variations include:
Bodyweight Squat
Goblet Squat
Landmine Squat
Front Squat
Dumbbell Squat
Machine Hack Squat
Smith Machine Squat
The emphasis of the squat can be switched from the quads to the hamstrings by your foot placement. Some wear shoes with an elevated heel (or elevate their heels on plates) to focus more on the quads. Others keep a flat foot to put more pressure on the hamstrings.
At the end of the day it is important that you pick a squat variation and foot placement that works best for you and that you can perform safely.

Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.
Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn''t, try adding some padding to the bar.
Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.
You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.
Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.
Take a small step back and stabilize yourself.
Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don''t lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.
Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels.
Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.', 'The are many mistakes that can be made when squatting, so it''s important that you have your technique down before you attempt squatting heavy weights. If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak.
Common mistakes when squatting:
Rounding the lower back: It''s crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.
Pushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.
Leaning forward: This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.
Knees come too far forward: When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.
Not squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.
Knees in or out: Don''t point your knees in or out when you''re lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.
Looking down: As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.',

There are sled push variations which have the elbows extended or bent. If the elbows are bent then you will load the hips more as you effectively take the upper back out of the equation given you’re shortening the lever arm and taking the shoulders out of flexion. If you keep the elbows locked out then you will have to fight for more thoracic extension during the movement. Neither is right or wrong, just depends on what you’re looking to accomplish.
Remember, with a sprint the goal should be technical proficiency and speed under some load. Not maximal load, some load. Keep it light enough that it doesn’t affect your technique.
If you find the front of the sled digging into the floor then you may need to grip slightly lower on the handles and/or ensure that your torso is inclined properly. If you start to get too upright then the sled will likely tilt forward and you’ll increase drag against the floor.
If you don’t have access to a sled, you can push a car or even a plate across astroturf.
Some prefer to push with the head down while others would rather look up. This is somewhat personal preference but it will also depend upon the individual and how they present in a resting position.
If someone exhibits more extension bias then they may want to experiment with looking down as this will help to keep them a bit more neutral.
If someone exhibits more flexion bias then they may want to experiment with looking up as this will help to drive more extension and keep them a bit more neutral.

Wall balls were made popular by Crossfit style WODs, but are also used in athletic populations looking to build explosive strength in an attempt to improve performance on their field of play.', 'Setup in an athletic base position while holding a medicine ball at your chest with a soft bend in your arms and knees.
Squat to parallel by simultaneously bending the hips and knees.
Drive upwards to full extension and drive the ball overhead explosively.
Catch the med ball as it returns from the wall and repeat steps #2-3 for the desired number of repetitions.', 'You can use these drills as “fillers” in between your large compound movements or you can implement them within your warm up as a method of potentiating your central nervous system for heavier strength based work in your accompanying training session.
Keep the torso rigid and ensure some tension through the core to help transmit force out through the extremities.
Initially you may want to focus on pausing in between reps to ensure proper positioning but over time you can eventually progress to more rhythmic (i.e. back to back) repetitions.
If you are using a denser medicine ball which will react with “an equal and opposite reaction” then you may want to stand a little ways back from the wall to allow yourself time to react.
However, if you’re using a more absorptive ball then you can stand closer and catch the ball as it comes directly off the wall.',

In particular, the wide stance machine hack squat will target the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.
Squat variations are extremely important to include in your workout routines, so it is important to find the right variation for you.
The wide stance used in this exercise will create additional tension in the inner quads, hamstrings, and glutes.
This exercise is best incorporated into your leg workouts or full body workouts.', 'Follow the instructions below for the wide hack squat. In the section below we''ve included some wide hack squat tips to help you get the most out of the exercise.
Load the machine with the desired weight and position your shoulders and back against the pads.
Position your feet outside of shoulder width, extend your legs, and release the safety handles.
Slowly lower the weight by bending your knees until your thighs are approximately at 90 degrees.
Reverse the movement by driving into the platform and extending the knees and hips.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.', 'Wide Hack Squat Tips From Our Coaches:
To keep tension on the quads, keep the knees just shy of lockout.
In order to emphasize the glutes more, push through the heels.
In order to emphasize the quads more, push through the balls of the feet.
Don’t allow the hips to posteriorly tilt and roll off the pad.
Keep your low back flat against the pad throughout the movement.
Ensure the head does not jut forward excessively.
Self spotting is possible by simply applying pressure to the knees with the hands. Use only when necessary.
Toe angle is individual and will depend upon each individual’s hip anatomy and ankle mobility - experiment and adjust based upon feel.',

The wide stance front squat primarily works the muscles of the quads, but also indirectly targets the remaining muscles of the leg.
The front squat, in general, helps lifters remain upright during the squat movement pattern simply by placing the weight in front of the body as opposed to behind the neck.
The wide stance used in the wide stance front squat will help lifters who are trying to target more of the hamstrings and glutes.', 'Position the bar just underneath shoulder height.
Position the hands just outside of shoulder width, step underneath the bar, and allow it to sit on the shoulders while driving the elbows high in front of the body.
Take a breath and unrack the bar by pushing your hips forward and extending your knees.
Take 2-3 steps back and position your feet wider than shoulder width.
Sit directly between your legs by simultaneously bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
Once your thighs reach parallel with the floor, begin to reverse the movement.
Keep your abs braced and drive your feet through the floor.
Finish the lift by exhaling as you fully extend the hips and knees.', 'Toe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you.
You can use either 2 or 3 fingers when front squatting in the front rack position as it will take some stress off the wrist.
To keep the torso upright, focus on driving the elbows up out of the hole.
If you can’t get into a front rack position to front squat, then use the cross arm grip.
Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.
Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.
Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.
Don’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe.',

The Zercher squat’s set up is quite unique, as you wedge the barbell in your elbow creases and hold the weight up by bracing your core and arms.
The Zercher squat can help those who struggle to maintain an upright torso during the back squat and also promote honest weight selection due to its difficult set up.
By mastering the Zercher squat, one can see huge increases in biceps, forearm, and leg size, as well as increases in total squat and deadlift numbers.', 'Set up a bar at roughly navel height.
Position the bar in the crook of the elbow between the bicep and forearm.
Inhale, stand up tall, and take 2 or 3 steps backward away from the J hooks.

Once your thighs reach parallel with the floor, begin to reverse the movement.
Keep your abs braced and drive your feet through the floor.
Finish the lift by exhaling as you fully extend the hips and knees.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.', 'Given that Zercher squats utilize an anterior load, you will have to fight the urge to excessively round the thoracic spine.
If you find issues with bicep tendon discomfort during the lift, utilize a t-shirt or towel wrapped around the bar.
The elbows should be about shoulder width apart and your knuckles facing the ceiling.
Your elbows will likely contact the thighs at the bottom of the lift, this is completely normal.
