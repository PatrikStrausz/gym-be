Using the tiger tail on the neck is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout.
When you perform SMR on your neck, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.', 'While in a seated position, position the tiger tail at the base of the neck with one hand on either handle.
Adjust pressure into neck by applying more or less force through the hands.
Slowly roll up and down the length of one side of the neck for 20-30 seconds.
Repeat on the other side.', 'The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.
If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.
In addition to some deep breathing, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.
Foam/stick rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.
HOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.',
