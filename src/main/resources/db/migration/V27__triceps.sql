Contract the chest and triceps to push the dumbbell back to the starting position.
Slowly lower the other dumbbell under control until your elbow touches the floor while keeping the other locked out at the top.
To complete the exercise, simply lower the weights to the ground in “controlled drop” fashion. It should be a smooth motion but not one requiring excessive effort or one that puts the shoulder under unnecessary risk.', 'Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely.
Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position.
Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself.
Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability.
Don’t bounce the elbows off the floor at the bottom of the rep. Doing so may result in injury due to the compressive forces being generated between the weight and the floor.

Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.
If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.
Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.
Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.
The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.
As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.
Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.
Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.
Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.
Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.
Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.
The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.
Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.
Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.
Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.
Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.
Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.
The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.',
