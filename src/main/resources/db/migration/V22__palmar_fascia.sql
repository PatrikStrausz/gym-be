        'Compression', 'Intermediate', 'None', 'Using a lacrosse ball to perform smr on your palmar fascia is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout, especially if you plan to perform upper body exercises that require the hands to be more mobile.
When you perform smr on the palmar fascia, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.', 'Place the lacrosse ball directly underneath the palm of your hand and apply pressure via your bodyweight.
Slowly roll the palmar region for 20-30 seconds.
Repeat on the other side.', 'The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.
Do not allow yourself to fall into overextension, keep tension through the abs.
If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.
Performing SMR may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.
If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.
If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.',
