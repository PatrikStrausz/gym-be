The exercise itself is a combination exercise which combines the cradle walk with a forward lunge. The cradle walk portion promotes increased mobility, and the forward lunge activates the muscles of the lower body.
This exercise is best used as a warm up on days you plan to perform lower body exercises such as squat variations.', 'In a standing position, quarter squat and position one leg in a figure four position.
Reach down and grab the ankle and knee of the non plant leg using a pronated grip.
Pull the leg upwards while keeping the chest tall and extending the planted leg.
Release the leg and step forward in a lunge position until the back knee touches the ground.
Repeat the process on the opposite leg for the desired number of repetitions.', 'Ensure you grab the ankle and NOT the sole of the foot. Pulling on the sole of the shoe will place unnecessary stress on the lateral portion of the ankle which is most susceptible to ankle sprains. Remember, ankle and knee - you shouldn’t be touching your shoe.
As you pull the leg upwards, ensure your chest does not round. Think about driving your head towards the ceiling as you lift.
Ensure the back knee is extended as some have a tendency to keep a slight amount of flexion.
You may receive additional benefit from completing a calf raise as you pull the leg up during the movement. This can help to mobilize the ankle as you are improving hip mobility on the opposite leg.
Do your best to keep the front shin vertical during the lunge. If you struggle with forward knee travel, regress to split squats and other movements where you must maintain a half kneeling position.',

Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.
