The abductors play a critical role in core stability and having strong abductors can result in better personal records on the squat and deadlift.
From an aesthetic perspective, performing hip abduction isolation exercises assists in the development of a full pair of glutes and hips.', 'Setup in an upright position with your back against the pad and your spine neutral.
Exhale and push the legs apart as you open the pads.
Once your hips are fully externally rotated, slowly return to the starting position.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.', 'Experiment with foot and pelvis position. Depending upon the shape of your hip, you may need a slightly more internal or external starting position to fully maximize the contraction.
Similarly, be mindful of your pelvic position - don’t allow the back to arch as this will tip the hips forward and place the adductors under excessive stretch before the contraction which can affect force output.
If you can’t seem to figure out how to change the position of your pelvis while seated, experiment with changing the position of the torso (i.e. lean forward or push your back into the pad).',
