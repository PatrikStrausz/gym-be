The 90/90 hip crossover drill will help relieve tension in the back muscles while also opening up the glutes and shoulders. It can also help increase mobility in the hips and slightly challenge the core.', 'In a supine position, lift your legs so that your hips and knees are at a 90 degree angle and ensure that your lower back is flat on the floor.
Reach your arms out to the side for support and slowly rotate your legs side to side.
Keep your head neutral and focus on controlling the rotation by utilizing your abdominals.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.', 'Ensure the feet don’t drop towards your butt as you get fatigued.
Keep the lower back as flat as possible against the floor and focus on feeling the movement in the upper back.

Incorporating them into your warm up routine will help you get better results and avoid injury.', 'In a seated position, roll backwards while tucking your chin and allow your legs to travel over your head with your arms outstretched to the sides.
Once your toes touch the floor (if possible), roll forward and spread your legs into a straddle position.
Reach forward as you roll forward and get a dynamic stretch through hamstrings and spinal erectors.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.', 'Focus on keeping your spine tall in the bottom position and don’t allow the weight to pull you forward.
Ideally you should be able to sit comfortably in the bottom position and open up the hips and ankles as you rock side to side.',

Extend your lower back by contracting your spinal erectors.
Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.', 'Make sure to keep some tension through your abs and glutes as you complete the movement. If you feeling a pressure or pinching sensation within one spinal vertebrae directly then you are dealing with an issue of segmental extension (usually at your thoracolumbar junction: T12-L1) versus global extension.
This movement is fairly outdated and there are much better options given the high level of compression that is generated within the spine itself during the course of the movement.',
